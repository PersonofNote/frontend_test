Plan:

-Use Bootstrap to do the heavy lifting.
-Header:
	-Left-justified <H1>, with a </p> under
-Utilize the jumbotron for the center content
	-Utilize the tab-switching logic built in to Bootstrap to swap between sections
	-Article section:
		-Each article is a horizontal div. Inside each is a picture and a text area with an <h(?)> and a <p>
	-Events section:
		-Each event is a vertical card. (Bootstrap has built-in cards that are close to this already.)
		-Each card has a colored date section, a text with an <h(?)> and a <p>, and a button-like div (but not a button because Bootstrap applies styling) that links to somewhere else.
	-Social links footer:
		-Semi-transparent div with inline icons.
